This page outlines how my research interests have evolved since the first year of college for those who enjoy listening to other people's lives as I do myself. I always found it helpful and interesting to hear other researcher's preceding paths before landing into their current interests especially when their trajectory is rather non-traditional, because the concepts and perspectives that don't seem to connect when seen individually often do converge beautifully when you see what's been going on behind closed doors.


## Freshman Year: Physics, Philosophy, Information

Before I start I would like to publicly thank my undergraduate institution, the College of Liberal Studies at Seoul National University (SNU CLS) for encouraging my chaotic journey, which is also addressed in my [graduation speech](https://cls.snu.ac.kr/board/story/view/15889) (in Korean!) I was honored to give.

As a high school kid I was one of those obsessed with AP Physics and the Physics Olympiad purely because of the joy of studying mathematically elegant models of how objects **interact** but also realized that my heart starts pounding even harder when I think about the myriad **interactions** in the society we live in. The South Korean college admissions system, at least back then, was not favorable for minds like myself as most students were forced to choose between STEM and liberal arts from high school and their exact major while applying to college. This is why I was extremely fortunate to matriculate at SNU CLS where those boundaries were nonexistent. 

As a freshman I enjoyed taking courses in the history and philosophy of science and CLS seminars on the physics, philosophy, biology, and sociology of knowledge and information in addition to the honors calculus and physics sequence, trying to connect physics with society. I was mesmerized by information and network theory along with how insights from physics could be used to understand social systems, unaware of the many caveats ahead of my road for pursuing such research.

## Sophomore Year: Knowledge Ecology

When it was time to declare my second major at CLS (you can probably infer what my first one is) I had no idea besides my feelings towards social science and information/knowledge. At the start of my sophomore year I registered for a junior-year course called *the Global Politics of Information,* attracted to all the words (networks, complexity, emergence, information, information, and so on) in the syllabus. This was taught by Prof. [Sangbae Kim](http://www.sangkim.net/index-e.html) who later became my advisor for the student-designed major called knowledge ecology. Since then I have roamed across Mt. Gwanak to hop around the departments of sociology, economics, political science, information science, and education for a single major, with the ambition to embrace different perspectives in studying the social science of knowledge formation and propagation. The [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) at the University of Chicago was a great reference for designing my major.

## Military Service: Complexity

Like most South Korean men I was mandated to serve for the military for about two years and for me that was during my sophomore year. Also like most South Korean men this was not the most exciting part in my life but I was privileged to serve as an English-Korean translator participating in several missions in collaboration with the US Army where I met some of my best friends.

During my little free time I enjoyed the break from SNU coursework and began taking courses (!) from the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) (SFI) where I was fascinated by the dynamic interaction between the system and the environment. *The Information* and *Chaos* by James Gleick, *Why Information Grows* by [César Hidalgo](https://cesarhidalgo.com/), and *Social Physics* by [Sandy Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/) are examples of books that bought my attention in data science, information system, and complexity science while I was ironically living in a digitally isolated environment. Back then I thought the [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) and the [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/) were relatively less scant shot for getting into MIT.

## Junior Year: Computation + Society

While I was browsing through all these books and SFI materials my junior year goal became clear: understand quantum/statistical mechanics and learn how to code. I cannot say much about the former except that I enjoyed it so much that I did not want the semesters to end and that this experience was a big jump in my mathematical maturity (I'm writing a post about why you should take these even though you're not a physics student).

For the latter, I joined the Human Centered Computing Lab at SNU to learn the basics of data science and machine learning led by Prof. [Bongwon Suh](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=-nlhtEkAAAAJ&hl=en). As a complex systems enthusiast who loves diversity and interdisciplinary research I was obsessed with the question "how actually interdisciplinary is the complexity science community?" While this topic was far from the Lab's main interests, I am thankful to Bongwon for teaching me everything I need to know in publishing [my first paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-67318-5_26). While I was aware that we should look into social systems at multiple levels, this was my first experience to actually do it computationally.
