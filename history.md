This page outlines how my research interests have evolved since the first year of college for those who enjoy listening to other people's lives as I do myself. I always found it helpful and interesting to hear other researcher's preceding paths before landing into their current interests especially when their trajectory is rather non-traditional, because the concepts and perspectives that don't seem to connect when seen individually often do converge beautifully when you see what's been going on behind closed doors.


## Freshman Year: Physics and Philosophy

Before I start I would like to publicly thank my undergraduate institution, the College of Liberal Studies at Seoul National University (SNU CLS) for encouraging my chaotic journey, which is also adressed in my [graduation speech](https://cls.snu.ac.kr/board/story/view/15889) (in Korean!) I was honored to give.

## Sophomore Year: Knowledge Ecology

My publications and ongoing projects so far are the results of collaborating with physicists, computer scientists, historians, biologists, cognitive scientists, and economists, which implies how open I am to interdisciplinary discussions. If there's any interesting research ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hesitate to write me an email!
