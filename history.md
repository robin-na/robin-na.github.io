This page outlines how my research interests have evolved since the first year of college for those who enjoy listening to other people's lives as I do myself. I always found it helpful and interesting to hear other researcher's preceding paths before landing into their current interests especially when their trajectory is rather non-traditional, because the concepts and perspectives that don't seem to connect when seen individually often do converge beautifully when you see what's been going on behind closed doors.


## Freshman Year: Physics, Philosophy, Information

Before I start I would like to publicly thank my undergraduate institution, the College of Liberal Studies at Seoul National University (SNU CLS) for encouraging my chaotic journey, which is also addressed in my [graduation speech](https://cls.snu.ac.kr/board/story/view/15889) (in Korean!) I was honored to give.

As a high school kid I was one of those obsessed with AP Physics and the Physics Olympiad purely because of the joy of studying mathematically elegant models of how objects **interact** but also realized that my heart starts beating even harder when I think about the myriad **interactions** in the society we live in. The South Korean college admissions system, at least back then, was not favorable for minds like myself as most students were forced to choose between STEM and liberal arts from high school and their exact major while applying to college. This is why I was extremely fortunate to matriculate at SNU CLS where those boundaries were nonexistent. 

As a freshman I enjoyed taking courses in the history and philosophy of science and CLS seminars on the physics, philosophy, biology, and sociology of knowledge and information in addition to the honors calculus and physics sequence, trying to connect physics with society. I was mesmerized by information and network theory along with how insights from physics could be used to understand social systems, unaware of the many caveats ahead of my road for pursuing such research.
