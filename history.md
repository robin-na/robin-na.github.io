This page outlines how my research interests have evolved since the first year of college for those who enjoy listening to other people's lives as I do myself. I always found it helpful and interesting to hear other researcher's preceding paths before landing into their current interests especially when their trajectory is rather non-traditional, because the concepts and perspectives that don't seem to connect when seen individually often do converge beautifully when you see what's been going on behind closed doors.


## Freshman Year: Physics and Philosophy

Before I start I would like to publicly thank my undergraduate institution, the College of Liberal Studies at Seoul National University (SNU CLS) for encouraging my chaotic journey, which is also adressed in my [graduation speech](https://cls.snu.ac.kr/board/story/view/15889) (in Korean!) I was honored to give. As a high school kid I was obsessed with AP Physics and Physics Olympiad purely because of the joy of studying mathematically elegant models of how objects interact but also realized that my heart starts beating even harder when I think about the myriad interactions in the society we live in.
