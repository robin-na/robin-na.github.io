This page outlines how my research interests have evolved since the first year of college for those who enjoy listening to other people's lives as I do myself. I always found it helpful and interesting to hear other researcher's preceding paths before landing into their current interests especially when their trajectory is rather non-traditional, because the concepts and perspectives that don't seem to connect when seen individually often do converge beautifully when you see what's been going on behind closed doors.


## Freshman Year: Physics, Philosophy, Information

Before I start I would like to publicly thank my undergraduate institution, the College of Liberal Studies at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) (SNU CLS) for encouraging my chaotic journey, which is also addressed in my [graduation speech](https://cls.snu.ac.kr/board/story/view/15889) (in Korean!) I was honored to give.

As a high school kid I was one of those obsessed with AP Physics and the Physics Olympiad purely because of the joy of studying mathematically elegant models of how objects **interact** but also realized that my heart starts pounding even harder when I think about the myriad **interactions** in the society we live in. The South Korean college admissions system, at least back then, was not favorable for minds like myself as most students were forced to choose between STEM and liberal arts from high school and their exact major while applying to college. This is why I was extremely fortunate to matriculate at SNU CLS where those boundaries were nonexistent. 

As a freshman I enjoyed taking courses in the history and philosophy of science and CLS seminars on the physics, philosophy, biology, and sociology of knowledge and information in addition to the honors calculus and physics sequence, trying to connect physics with society. I was mesmerized by information and network theory along with how insights from physics could be used to understand social systems, unaware of the many caveats ahead of my road for pursuing such research.

## Sophomore Year: Knowledge Ecology

When it was time to declare my second major at CLS (you can probably infer what my first one is) I had no idea besides my feelings towards social science and information/knowledge. At the start of my sophomore year I registered for a junior-year course called *the Global Politics of Information,* attracted to all the words (networks, complexity, emergence, information, information, and so on) in the syllabus. This was taught by Prof. [Sangbae Kim](http://www.sangkim.net/index-e.html) who later became my advisor for the student-designed major called knowledge ecology. Since then I have roamed across Mt. Gwanak to hop around the departments of sociology, economics, political science, information science, and education for a single major, with the ambition to embrace different perspectives in studying the social science of knowledge formation and propagation. The [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) at the University of Chicago was a great reference for designing my major.

## Military Service: Complexity

Like most South Korean men I was mandated to serve in the military for about two years. Also like most South Korean men this was not the most exciting part of my life but I was privileged to serve as an English-Korean translator participating in several missions in collaboration with the US Army where I met some of my best friends outside of SNU and academia.

During my little free time I enjoyed the break from SNU coursework and began taking courses (!) from the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) (SFI) where I was fascinated by the dynamic interaction between the system and the environment. I also basked in books about chaos, information theory, and the use of big data and information systems in social science research, ironically in a digitally isolated environment. 

<!---
*The Information* and *Chaos* by James Gleick, *Why Information Grows* by [César Hidalgo](https://cesarhidalgo.com/), and *Social Physics* by [Sandy Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/) are examples of books that bought my attention in data science, information system, and complexity science while I was ironically living in a digitally isolated environment. Back then I thought the [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) and the [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/) were relatively less scant shot for getting into MIT.

## Junior Year: Computation + Society

<!---
While I was browsing through all these books and SFI materials my junior year goal became clear: understand quantum/statistical mechanics and learn how to code. I cannot say much about the former except that I enjoyed it so much that I did not want the semesters to end and that this experience was a big jump in my mathematical maturity (I'm writing a post about why you should take these even though you're not a physics student).

One thing I learned through that digital isolation is that I need to write computer programs to do anything related to complexity!

I joined the Human Centered Computing Lab at SNU to learn the basics of data science and machine learning led by Prof. [Bongwon Suh](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=-nlhtEkAAAAJ&hl=en). As a complex systems enthusiast who loves diversity and interdisciplinary research I was obsessed with the question "is the complexity science community really interdisciplinary, or is it just a collection of heterogeneous disciplines with little actual interaction?" While this topic was far from the Lab's main interests, I am thankful to Bongwon for teaching me everything I need to know in publishing [my first paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-67318-5_26). While I was aware that we should look into social systems at multiple scales, this was my first experience to actually do it computationally.

I spent my summer at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) and joined a Korean history data analysis project co-led by two physicists Profs. Juyong Park and [Hawoong Jeong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-Jhj6swAAAAJ&hl=en). At the end of the summer I reached out to Prof. [Javier Cha](https://javiercha.com/), a digital historian at SNU CLS for advice in analyzing longitudinal historical data and this is the moment when my network analysis has turned into [a paper in Korean history](https://ijkh.khistory.org/journal/view.php?number=540). I was building my [strength of weak ties](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/225469)! 

## Senior Year: Multiscale Analysis

Playing with data was fun, but I wanted to get a more thorough and understanding in the mathematics behind networks and complex systems.

At the start of my senior year I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Bryan Daniels](https://www.public.asu.edu/~bdaniel6/) at the [ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems](https://www.santafe.edu/research/initiatives/asu-sfi-center-biosocial-complex-systems) thanks to my exchange student program at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). We worked on developing novel algorithms and metrics to measure the meso-level properties of networks by applying clique problems. This was my attempt to mathematically formulate ways to analyze networks at multiple scales, extending to my multi-level network data analysis in the previous year.

I finished my thesis in physics while working closely with [Alexander Siegenfeld](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aXMvbIUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Blake Elias](http://blakeelias.name/) at the [New England Complex Systems Institute](https://necsi.edu/). I constructed mathematical theory for the coarse-graining and renormalization of disease dynamics using statistical physics, linear algebra, differential equations, and Markov processes. This project taught me the importance of evaluating the assumptions in models that may not be generalized in different scales. I also learned how to think about not only different scales of interactions but also interactions between different scales.

## Post-Graduate: Cognitive Science

It became clear over the years that my research motivation at the coarsest scale is to understand collective human behavior. Just as I realized that a deep investigation into human cognition is unavoidable for such topics, I met just the right mentor to introduce me to the field.

Right after graduation I was thrilled to work with Prof. [Simon DeDeo](https://sites.santafe.edu/~simon/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) who is also part of SFI with doctoral training in physics. Simon exposed me to the fascinating world of cognitive science and natural language processing as we constructed methods to classify [how people make arguments in the wild](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/20n240qq). We were able to discover strong signals for social aspects of argument-making when it comes to predicting their efficacy, with implications that people do may argue just for the sake of claiming that they have the correct information but possibly for the sake of sharing their view on the larger system. 

## Present: Management Science

At the start of 2022, I was fortunate to receive offers from the strongest PhD programs in [computer science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), [psychology](https://psych.princeton.edu/), and across many different fields in business schools, which was rather unexpected as I had no courses from these departments recorded in my diverse transcript (you can scroll back up to my sophomore year). Through the tough decision process I felt the need to complement my skill set with the ability to perform experimental design for causal inference and understand the nuts and bolts of machine learning algorithms. I am extremely happy to be in a PhD program where I am encouraged to continue my interdisciplinary discussions while honing my mathematical fluency that I have always been obsessed with!
