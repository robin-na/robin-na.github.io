## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in [Information Technology](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us) at MIT Sloan, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, scientific knowledge, and societal decision-making. My research is particularly centered on the generalization problem, which encompasses domain generalization in machine learning and the generalizability crisis in the social sciences. Ultimately, the investigation aims to enhance human decision-making under shifting environments through AI systems that integrate scientific knowledge with a wide spectrum of underrepresented social contexts.

I interned at Amazon Alexa AI for the summer of 2023 and am joining Amazon Search AI in 2024, specializing in multimodal generative models!

In one stream, I explore how to advance research methodologies in social and organizational science through integrative/adaptive experiment and interpretable machine learning. This contributes to the second stream, which is to develop a better understanding of how the omnipresence of algorithmic decision-making influences our knowledge ecosystem. Optimistically, how can algorithms help us expand our knowledge by connecting the dots and revealing rich dimensions of subtleties previously less explored by humans? Pessimistically, how can algorithmic biases perpetuate social stratification or contribute to polarization and suboptimal collective performance? -->

<!---
broadly interested in deploying various computational methods to understand collective human behaviors in IT-driven society. Such methods include network analysis, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, causal inference, and adaptive experiments. My ambitious research goal is to employ IT in a way that contributes to society where diverse ideas and backgrounds are appreciated while preventing polarization and discrimination that can be caused by social media and machine learning algorithms. This explains my current interests in algorithmic fairness and social network.

Before MIT, I was a research fellow at Carnegie Mellon University specializing in language models and argumentation. I received a B.S. in physics and a B.A. in knowledge ecology from Seoul National University.

My studies have been generously supported by scholarships with the most competitive funding in South Korea: SBS Foundation Scholarship (graduate) and the Presidential Science Scholarship in physics (undergraduate).

## Connect

My publications and ongoing projects so far are the results of collaborating with physicists, computer scientists, historians, cognitive scientists, and political scientists, which implies how open I am to interdisciplinary discussions. If there's any interesting research ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hesitate to write me an email!
