## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in [Information Technology](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us) at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), broadly interested in deploying various computational methods to understand collective human behaviors in IT-driven society. Such methods include network analysis, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, causal inference, and adaptive experiments. My self-aggrandizing ambitious research goal is to employ IT in a way that contributes to society where diverse ideas and backgrounds are appreciated while preventing polarizations and hiring biases that can be caused by social media and machine learning algorithms, which explains my current interests in algorithmic fairness and social network.

Some topics I enjoy talking a lot about include but are certainly not limited to:

- Multiscale analysis and interactions between those scales in complex adaptive systems
- Interconnectivity in information/social networks including its downside
- The benefit of diversity in many contexts and the difficulty of managing it
- Attention economy in digital environment in web2 and web3
- Challenges and opportunities in computational social science

<!---
(emergent patterns, feedback loop, adaptive behavior)
(Braess's paradox, information cascade, the strength of weak ties)
(the diversity-bandwidth trade-off, the diversity prediction theorem, interdisciplinary research)
(web3, regulatory function, attention economy)
(integrating explanation and prediction, the replication crisis, FAT machine learning)

Before MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working on natural language processing and computational cognitive science. I received my B.S. in [physics](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en) and B.A. in knowledge ecology (student-designed major) from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) where I was fortunate to collaborate with amazing researchers from the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), [New England Complex Systems Institute](https://necsi.edu/), and [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) as an undergraduate. You can read a longer version of this paragraph in my [background](/background.md) section!

My studies have been generously supported by the highest paying merit-based scholarships in South Korea: SBS Foundation Fellowship for Future Talent (graduate) and the [Presidential Science Scholarship](https://www.kosaf.go.kr/eng/jsp/aid/aid02_01_01.jsp) in physics (undergraduate).

## Connect

My publications and ongoing projects so far are the results of collaborating with physicists, computer scientists, historians, biologists, cognitive scientists, and economists, which implies how open I am to interdisciplinary discussions. If there's any interesting research ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hesitate to write me an email!
