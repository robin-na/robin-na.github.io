## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in [Information Technology](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us) at MIT Sloan working on large language models, metascience, and human-AI decision-making. I work on generative AI for enhancing research methods in social science, which in turn also improves the AI's ability to better represent human behavior under diverse contexts. This reciprocal improvement between computer science and social science ultilmately contributes to understanding and improving how decision-makers engage with scientific knowledge in the era of generative AI.

I interned at Amazon Alexa AI and Amazon Search AI for two summers of my PhD, specializing in social networks, LLMs, and knowledge retrieval.

Before joining MIT, I was a research fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in language models and human cognition. I hold a B.S. in physics and a B.A. in knowledge ecology from Seoul National University.

My studies have been generously supported by scholarships with the most competitive funding in South Korea: SBS Foundation Scholarship (graduate) and the Presidential Science Scholarship in physics (undergraduate).

In one stream, I explore how to advance research methodologies in social and organizational science through integrative/adaptive experiment and interpretable machine learning. This contributes to the second stream, which is to develop a better understanding of how the omnipresence of algorithmic decision-making influences our knowledge ecosystem. Optimistically, how can algorithms help us expand our knowledge by connecting the dots and revealing rich dimensions of subtleties previously less explored by humans? Pessimistically, how can algorithmic biases perpetuate social stratification or contribute to polarization and suboptimal collective performance? -->

<!---
broadly interested in deploying various computational methods to understand collective human behaviors in IT-driven society. Such methods include network analysis, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, causal inference, and adaptive experiments. My ambitious research goal is to employ IT in a way that contributes to society where diverse ideas and backgrounds are appreciated while preventing polarization and discrimination that can be caused by social media and machine learning algorithms. This explains my current interests in algorithmic fairness and social network.
