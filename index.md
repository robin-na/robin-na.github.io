## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in [Information Technology](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us) at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), broadly interested in deploying various computational methods to understand collective human behaviors in IT-driven society. My self-aggrandizing, ambitious research goal is to employ IT in a way that contributes to society where diverse ideas and backgrounds are appreciated while preventing polarizations and hiring biases that can be caused by social media and machine learning algorithms. Such methods include network analysis, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, causal inference, and adaptive experiments.

Before MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working on natural language processing and computational cognitive science. I received my B.S. in [physics](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en) and B.A. in knowledge ecology (student-designed major) from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) where I was fortunate to collaborate with amazing researchers from the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), [New England Complex Systems Institute](https://necsi.edu/), and [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) as an undergraduate.

My studies have been generously supported by the highest paying merit-based scholarships in South Korea: SBS Foundation Fellowship for Future Talent (graduate for 6 years) and the [Presidential Science Scholarship](https://www.kosaf.go.kr/eng/jsp/aid/aid02_01_01.jsp) in physics (undergraduate for 4 years).

## Contact

My publications and ongoing projects so far are the results of collaborating with physicists, computer scientists, historians, biologists, cognitive scientists, and economists, which implies how open I am to interdisciplinary discussions. If there's any interesting research ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hesitate to write me an email!
