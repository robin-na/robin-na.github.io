## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in [Information Technology](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us) at MIT Sloan, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, scientific knowledge, and human-AI decision-making. In other words, I investigate in multiple aspects of human-AI-science interaction for improved decision-making as a computer scientist and a social scientist.

As a computer scientist, I focus on building generative models that improve predictions by integrating scientific resources and providing recommendations that are both accurate and appealing to human decision-makers. As a social scientist, I conduct metascientific critiques to identify which scientific findings are useful for predictions in different contexts and assess the enterprise's effectiveness of generating cumulative knowledge for predicting social phenomena.

Currently, I am an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon, specializing in large language models and knowledge representation. I interned at Amazon Alexa AI during the summer of 2023.

Before joining MIT, I was a research fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in language models and human cognition. I hold a B.S. in physics and a B.A. in knowledge ecology from Seoul National University.

My studies have been generously supported by scholarships with the most competitive funding in South Korea: SBS Foundation Scholarship (graduate) and the Presidential Science Scholarship in physics (undergraduate).

In one stream, I explore how to advance research methodologies in social and organizational science through integrative/adaptive experiment and interpretable machine learning. This contributes to the second stream, which is to develop a better understanding of how the omnipresence of algorithmic decision-making influences our knowledge ecosystem. Optimistically, how can algorithms help us expand our knowledge by connecting the dots and revealing rich dimensions of subtleties previously less explored by humans? Pessimistically, how can algorithmic biases perpetuate social stratification or contribute to polarization and suboptimal collective performance? -->

<!---
broadly interested in deploying various computational methods to understand collective human behaviors in IT-driven society. Such methods include network analysis, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, causal inference, and adaptive experiments. My ambitious research goal is to employ IT in a way that contributes to society where diverse ideas and backgrounds are appreciated while preventing polarization and discrimination that can be caused by social media and machine learning algorithms. This explains my current interests in algorithmic fairness and social network.

## Connect

My publications and ongoing projects so far are the results of collaborating with physicists, computer scientists, historians, cognitive scientists, and sociologists, which implies how open I am to interdisciplinary discussions. If there's any interesting research ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hesitate to write me an email!
