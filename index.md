## About Me

I am a PhD student in [Information Technology](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us) at MIT, broadly interested in developing generative models and knowledge representation techniques for intelligent decision support system. Moreover, I am working towards de-biasing such models to prevent overgeneralization, ensuring they accurately reflect the heterogeneity of our experiences.

I interned at Amazon Alexa AI for the summer of 2023.

In one stream, I explore how to advance research methodologies in social and organizational science through integrative/adaptive experiment and interpretable machine learning. This contributes to the second stream, which is to develop a better understanding of how the omnipresence of algorithmic decision-making influences our knowledge ecosystem. Optimistically, how can algorithms help us expand our knowledge by connecting the dots and revealing rich dimensions of subtleties previously less explored by humans? Pessimistically, how can algorithmic biases perpetuate social stratification or contribute to polarization and suboptimal collective performance? -->

broadly interested in deploying various computational methods to understand collective human behaviors in IT-driven society. Such methods include network analysis, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, causal inference, and adaptive experiments. My ambitious research goal is to employ IT in a way that contributes to society where diverse ideas and backgrounds are appreciated while preventing polarization and discrimination that can be caused by social media and machine learning algorithms. This explains my current interests in algorithmic fairness and social network.

Before MIT, I received my B.S. in physics and B.A. in knowledge ecology (student-designed major) from Seoul National University. After that, I was at Carnegie Mellon University as a research fellow in NLP and cognitive science.

My studies have been generously supported by scholarships with the most competitive funding in South Korea: SBS Foundation Scholarship (graduate) and the Presidential Science Scholarship in physics (undergraduate).

## Connect

My publications and ongoing projects so far are the results of collaborating with physicists, computer scientists, historians, biologists, cognitive scientists, and political scientists, which implies how open I am to interdisciplinary discussions. If there's any interesting research ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hesitate to write me an email!
