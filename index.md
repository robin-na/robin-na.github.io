## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in [Information Technology](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us) at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), broadly interested in the myriad interactions happening. My self-aggrandizing, ambitious research goal is to contribute to the IT-driven society where diverse ideas and backgrounds are appreciated such as , along with deploying various computational methodologies to deepen  in social science.

Before MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow Carnegie Mellon University's [Laboratory for Social Minds](https://sites.santafe.edu/~simon/) working on natural language processing and computational cognitive science. I recieved my B.S. in [physics](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en) and B.A. in knowledge ecology (student-designed major) from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) where I was fortunate to collaborate with amazing researchers from the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), [New England Complex Systems Institute](https://necsi.edu/), and [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) as an undergraduate.

## Contact

My publications and ongoing projects so far are the results of collaborating with physicists, computer scientists, historians, biologists, cognitive scientists, and economists which implies how open I am to interdisciplinary discussions! If there's any interesting research ideas you would like to discuss, please don't hesitate to write me an email!
